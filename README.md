## Usage

The documentation website covers all of the modules contained in the RDT package. [View docs &rsaquo;](https://unscriptedvn.github.io/rdt/)

### Example Usage: Notarizing a macOS build
```py
import renpy_distribute_tools as rdt

author = "Joe Smith"
bundle_identifier = "com.example.my-vn"
code_sign_identity = "Developer ID Application: Joe Smith (XXXXXXXXXX)"
app_path = "VN-1.0.0-dists/VN-1.0.0-mac/VN.app"
apple_email = "example.joesmith@icloud.com"
apple_provider = "XXXXXXXXXX"

rdt.fix_plist(app_path + "/Contents/Info.plist",
          bundle_identifier,
          "Â© %s %s. All rights reserved." % (date.today().year, author))
rdt.code_sign(code_sign_identity,
          app_path,
          entitlements="../../entitlements.plist",
          enable_hardened_runtime=True)
try:
    rdt.upload_to_notary(app_path,
                     bundle_identifier,
                     apple_email,
                     "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD",
                     provider=apple_provider)
except CalledProcessError:
    print("\033[31;1mNotarization request failed. Aborting.\033[0m")
    sys.exit(1)
```
